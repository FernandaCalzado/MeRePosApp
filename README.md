# Medical Record Point Of Sale And Appointment

It's a Open source **EMR (Electronic Medical Record)**, to create an entire ecosystem than work for almost any doctor it doesn’t matter their specialty; to make easier their road to the digitalization and make an efficient use of the source at time to work with **Medical Records, Appointments, Bills** and some other cool features like **Loans, Payment Agreement, Emergencies, Admission** and much more.

The main objective of this project is not to be a commercial product as it, on the first part, because it will be part of a course than will make you learn how to program from zero to a real-world profitable project in a mix of some technologies than have been worked at mid and expert level in practice. 

For that reason, the code will not implement the best design pattern on the main three, because the code its focused on what its proved than work most for learn how to program for beginners and not for pro or god-programmers.

But, how its open and the implementation than will be used here, are implemented on a real product than have been use by 2 big Hospital from Dominican Republic, and used by more than 40 individual Doctors on their daily practice, this can be used for you in something more than just learn like win a lot of money selling your own rebranded solution (You CAN’T use the same name than this project “Mere PosApp” for none reason) without any legal problem, or make you an affiliate of this product.
